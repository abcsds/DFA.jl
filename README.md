## Introduction
The DFA package provides tools to perform a [detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detrended_fluctuation_analysis) and estimates the scaling exponent from the results. DFA is used to characterize long memory dependence in stochastic fractal time series.

## Install
To install the package:

`pkg> add https://github.com/abcsds/DFA.jl`

## Usage Examples
We'll perform a DFA and estimates the scaling exponent for a random time series.
```
using DFA

x = rand(10000)
<!-- n, Fn = dfa(x) -->
Fn = dfa(x)
```
You can also specify the following key arguments:

* **order**:  the order of the polynomial fit. Default: `1`.
* **overlap**:  the overlap of blocks in partitioning the time data expressed as a fraction in [
0,1). A positive overlap will slow down the calculations slightly with the (possible)
effect of generating less biased results. Default: `0`.
* **boxmax**: an integer denoting the maximum block size to use in partitioning the data. Default:
`div(length(x), 2)`.
* **boxmin**: an integer denoting the minimum block size to use in partitioning the data. Default: `2*(order+1)`.
* **boxratio**: the ratio of successive boxes. This argument is used as an input to the logScale
function. Default: `2`.

To perform a DFA on x with boxmax=1000, boxmin=4, boxratio=1.2, overlap=0.5:
```
scales, fluc = dfa(x, boxmax=1000, boxmin=4, boxratio=1.2, overlap=0.5)
```
To estimates the scaling exponent:
```
intercept, α = polyfit(log10(scales), log10(fluc))  # α is scaling exponent
```
To plot F(n):
```
using plots

scatter(scales, fluc, "o")
```
To plot F(n) with fitted line:
```
log_scales = log10(scales)
plot(log_scales, log10(fluc), "o", log_scales, α.*log_scales.+intercept)
```
